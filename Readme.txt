== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I lock myself out? =

Yes, it is only possible after you've configured the plugin. To prevent it, check your registered email before checking 'require email logon'. If you lock yourself out, you can always remove the plugin via FTP. For any other lockout mechanism we employ reset links and timed lockout mechanism.

= Is this WPMU (Network site) compatible =

Yes, it is tested for networkbased websites and it works as expected.
